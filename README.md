# Word Frequency in a Collection of Documents (absolute and weighted)


Interesting insights can be gained when text documents (tweets, keywords, web pages, etc) have associated numeric metrics with them.

This is a description of how this can be done through a Python function.

The notebook describes the process starting from a collection of two one-word 'documents' up to analyzing a list of 15,000 
movie titles together with their lifetime gross revenue. 

Additional data sets are provided for illustration and practice.
